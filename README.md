# Time Force Pizzeria

## Description

The Time Force Pizzeria is a Mighty Morphin' Pizzeria that offers a seamless platform for customers to explore our menu, place orders, and enjoy delicious pizzas delivered right to their doorstep.

### Future Development --
With only the basics for now, Stripe functionality is to be added to allow for payment to be made online as the order is processed. Other future features include things such as customizable options on pizza and side orders, and a favorites tab for users' favorite items on the menu. Users will also be able to leave reviews for any items they've ordered in the past.
